# Predicting Customer Churn Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning models. By analyzing customer behavior and service usage data, the system identifies patterns that indicate the likelihood of a customer leaving, allowing businesses to take proactive retention measures.

## Features
- Binary classification (churn vs. no churn)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer patterns
- Model training using Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## How to Use
1. Load the dataset (dataset.csv)
2. Run `source_code.py`
3. View metrics and predictions
